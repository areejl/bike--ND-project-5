# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Areej Asiri

## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is a bike-sharing service provided by Ford Motor Company, and the dataset would likely include information such as the following:
Trip data (e.g. start and end time, start and end station, duration, etc.)
User data (e.g. member type, gender, etc.)
Bike data (e.g. bike ID)



## Summary of Findings

> Based on the univariate analysis, it was found that the busiest hour for the bike-sharing system is at 5:00 PM, with approximately 20,000 trips starting during that hour. The majority of the system's members are male, with a total count of 129,252. The ages of the users range from 25 to 65 years old, with a mean age of 35. In the bivariate analysis, it was discovered that subscribers have an average trip duration of approximately 11 minutes. The largest age group of users falls within the 26-35 age range, and the histogram of trip duration in seconds shows a positive skew, with a high peak at 600 seconds (10 minutes) and a long tail towards the right. Finally, in the multivariate analysis, the heatmap graph displays the correlation matrix between the variables in the dataset. One notable finding is that the start_station_longitude variable has a strong positive correlation of 0.99 with the end_station_longitude variable.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The overall goals of the analysis presentation are to provide insights into the user demographics and usage patterns of a platform that offers bike-sharing services. The presentation includes a combination of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore different aspects of the data and identify patterns and relationships between variables.
Key insights from the presentation include:
- The majority of users are male, with a proportion of 74.5%, and the largest age group falls within the 26-35 age range, indicating that the platform is most popular among young to middle-aged adults.
- The correlation analysis shows a strong positive correlation between the start and end station longitudes, which may have implications for the selection of appropriate analytical methods.
- The analysis also highlights a difference in usage patterns between subscribers and customers, with subscribers having a significantly shorter average trip duration compared to customers, which may inform the service providers in tailoring their offerings to meet the needs of both groups.
- These insights can be valuable for informing decisions regarding marketing strategies, content creation, and user experience design, as well as guiding the selection of appropriate analytical methods for future analyses.
